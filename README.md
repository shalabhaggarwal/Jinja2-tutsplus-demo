### Tuts+ Tutorial: Templating With Jinja2 in Flask

#### Instructor: Shalabh Aggarwal

Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional sandboxed environment. It is small but fast apart from being an easy to use standalone template engine. Flask is a Python based micro web framework which allows you to write your web applications quickly and efficiently. In this three part series, I will start with the basics of Jinja2 templating from the perspective of Flask. In the subsequent parts of this series, I will cover advanced templating topics while learning how to layout templates in a Flask based application in a modular and extensible design.
